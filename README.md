## Problem Statement:
* The problem is the lack of an accurate and efficient system for insurance companies to assess the severity of vehicle damages, leading to delayed claims processing and unfair payouts. 
* To address this issue, an automatic damaged vehicle estimator framework using enhanced deep learning algorithms can be developed. 
* The framework aims to detect and analyze various types of damages and provide insurance companies with an objective and reliable estimate of the severity of the damage. 
* By implementing this framework, insurance companies can streamline the assessment process, improve accuracy and speed of assessments, and effectively manage claims related to vehicle damages.

## Technologies Used:
*  To build this framework, technologies such as computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms will be used.
*  Other technologies that may be utilized include image processing, natural language processing, and data analytics. 
*  For building the front-end we have used React.js and streamlit (that should run at localhost:8501).

## Data Models: 
* We have trained six data models that asks the user to upload the image and figures out the object.
* We provide features such as:
<ul>
  <li>Object Detection- Focusing on car model, tire and oil.</li>
  <li>Damage on the air.</li>
  <li>Tire thread damage and estimating the life-span.</li>
  <li>Oil life span by recognising the color and estimating it.</li>
